  <template id="Programming">While I had attempted to teach myself game design as a kid, I didn't truly take an interest in programming until I took an introductory Computer Science class in my first year of university.<br><br>I continued with the Computer Science curriculum and started learning additional topics as a hobby, such as logic programming in SWI Prolog and practicing web development with this site, and I was eventually compelled to switch my major from Electrical&nbsp;Engineering to Computer&nbsp;Engineering, which would give me the chance to work on both hardware and software.<br><br>Languages/Frameworks: Python, Javascript/HTML/Electron, Scheme, C&nbsp;(beginner), SWI&nbsp;Prolog&nbsp;(beginner)</template>
  <template id="Drums">At 20 years of age, I've been playing concert percussion and drum set for nearly half my life. In addition to playing in jazz and concert bands throughout middle school and high school, frequenting local jazz jams, and playing in the occasional theatre pit, I also participated in the University of New Hampshire's Summer Youth Music School for three years during high school as a member of the top jazz band.<br><br>While I've played just about every genre on drum set, recently I've been focusing on folk and bluegrass, jazz, Afro-Cuban, and electronic music.<br><br>I am currently a member of the University of Connecticut Percussion Ensemble and study with Kevin Fortunato for drum set.</template>
